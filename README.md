## üöÄ Getting Started

This application is designed to run in an environment where the Google Gemini API key is securely managed.

### Prerequisites

You must have a Google Gemini API key.

### Configuration

The application requires the Gemini API key to be available as an environment variable named `API_KEY`. The `GeminiService` (`src/services/gemini.service.ts`) is configured to read this key directly from `process.env.API_KEY`.

```typescript
// From src/services/gemini.service.ts
constructor() {
  if (!process.env.API_KEY) {
    throw new Error("API_KEY environment variable not set");
  }
  this.genAI = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: process.env.API_KEY });
}
```

Ensure this environment variable is set in your deployment or development environment before running the application.
